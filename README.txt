System Functionalities and User Roles
1. Setting Up the Development Environment
To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

Install Visual Studio:

Download and install Visual Studio from visualstudio.microsoft.com.
During installation, ensure you select the ASP .NET and web development workload.
Clone the Repository:

Clone the repository from GitHub: git clone <repository-url>
Open the project in Visual Studio:
Launch Visual Studio.
Select Open a project or solution.
Navigate to the cloned repository and open the solution file (.sln).
Install Dependencies:

Visual Studio will automatically restore the necessary NuGet packages upon opening the solution. If not, you can manually restore them by right-clicking on the solution in the Solution Explorer and selecting Restore NuGet Packages.
Configuration:

If there are any configuration files (e.g., Resources.resx), ensure they are properly set up with your environment-specific variables.
Database Setup (if applicable):

If the prototype requires a database, follow the provided database setup instructions. Ensure your database server is running and that the connection strings in Resources.resx are correctly configured.
2. Building and Running the Prototype
Follow these steps to build and run the prototype:

Build the Project:

In Visual Studio, select Build > Build Solution from the top menu or press Ctrl+Shift+B.
Run the Project:

To run the project, press F5 or click on the Start button in Visual Studio.
This will start the web server and launch the application in your default web browser.
Access the Prototype:

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:PORT, where PORT is the port number assigned by Visual Studio.
Testing:

If there are automated tests, they can typically be run from the Test Explorer in Visual Studio. Open Test > Windows > Test Explorer and run all tests.
